## Reporting A Bug

Please use the following template when reporting a bug. Simply copy and paste the following template into your new issue and add your answers to the end of each question. Please do not alter the template or use it incorrectly. It makes things easier to read if you follow things properly!

Your issue title should be the bug name as well!

* **Bug Date and Time** should be the date and time you experienced the bug. This helps us review the logs around the same time to see if there are any errors happening.
* **Bug Name** should be a brief name of the bug. Something simple that helps describe what the bug is.
* **Steps To Reproduce The Bug** should be a list of steps that are taken to make the bug happen. This helps us reproduce the bug and find the reason it is happening.

## Forewarning!

Failure to follow these templates will result in your issue being closed and ignored. I am not going to babysit people and explain to them how to read the rules. If you ignore them you will be ignored in return.

Please review the current issues reported as well before making a new bug report or feature request. Your report may already exist. Feel free to add more information to an existing report if that is the case. The more info possible on something the better.

Please be sure to only post 1 bug report or feature request per-ticket. You can make as many bug reports or feature requests as you like. Just be sure to only post one in each ticket!
